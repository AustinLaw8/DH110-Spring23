                <h2>About the App</h2>
                Airwaves is meant to mimic the experience of watching videos and movies together with friends. With everyone living such busy lives, sometimes its hard to actually meet up in person to do something as simple as watch the latest TV show together. This app aims to facilitate video calls and watch parties so that friends and family can have the feeling of watching shows, videos, and movies together even when separated by the airwaves. This app was inspired by my own wants; I have often wanted to watch YouTube videos, or videos on other websites, with my friends, and have resorted to using apps like Zoom to share my screen with my friends and watch videos together.
                
                <!-- Design Statement -->
                <h2> Design Statement </h2>
                The "issue" is that it is often difficult to meet up in person if you want to casually watch things with your friends and families, with people living far from each other or having packed schedules. It is important to resolve this issue because these kinds of gatherings are forms of quality time at minimum, or powerful bonding experiences at best.
                
                <!-- Competitor analysis [assignment01 & 02] -->
                <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    Existing solutions to this task usually are poorly designed or designed for other tasks, and simply happen to fill this niche. Specifically, the most common way of completing this task is to use a video calling tool, such as Zoom or Discord, and share your screen with the others in the call. However, screen sharing often suffers from reduced audio and visual quality for everyone that is not the person sharing, and also can suffer from desync and lag due to internet connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are some products designed specifically to host watch parties with others. I analyzed two other products: <a href="https://www.kastapp.co">kastapp</a> and <a href="https://www.watchparty.me">watchparty</a>. I studied the heuristics of both apps and conducted a usability test of watchparty. Overall, I discovered that these competitors, while fulfilling their role, suffer from a few major usability flaws that make them annoying or difficult to use. I also conducted a usability test for watchparty, to gain a better understanding of what potential UI/UX decisions are good or bad.

                <h2>User Research</h2>
                <p>
                    To conduct my user research, I interviewed a young adult (college student) and asked them to do a few tasks related to and including hosting watchparties with friends. I tried to give as little guidance as possible to see their natural course of action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through my user research, I discovered that people often use screen sharing (such as through Zoom) to host watchparties due to a lack of better tools. I also learned that, in extreme cases, sometimes people will use convoluted methods such as directly videoing the content they want to watch. Finally, poor internet connection usually results in a poor experience for everyone when screen sharing, since video or audio quality will be lost.

                <h2>UX Storytelling</h2>
                <p>
                    I created two personas to try to gain a better understanding of my users and their goals. These personas were: Margaret Smith, an over-worked, middle-aged mother looking to reconnect with her children, and Austin Law, a busy but energetic college student who is up too late at night. I created empathy maps and journey maps for these personas, looking to understand what they do and why they do it.

                <h2>Low-Fidelity prototype</h2>
                <p>
                    To get an initial sense of what I wanted my app to look like, I created a low-fidelity prototype of the app, with some of the major screens needed to complete the basic task, as well as some wireflows to get a sense of navigation. Then, I had a user test the app, attempting to navigate the app to complete the basic tasks.

                <p>
                    After creating the initial low-fidelity prototype, I experimented with various element variation. Namely, I tried different typography, colors, and shapes.

                <p>
                    I also ran a quick impression test of the design, from which I learned that the design of app is generally understandable and aesthetically pleasing.

                <p>
                    After making the final few decisions on the graphic design element variations, I created a high-fidelity, interactive prototype with functional wireflows.

                <p>
                    I also conducted a cognitive walkthrough of the interactive prototype, learning if my app was intuitive and understandable. From this, I learned that there were some specific buttons that the function of which were not obvious.
