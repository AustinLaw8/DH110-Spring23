        <!-- About -->
        <h2>About the app</h2>
        Airwaves is meant to mimic the experience of watching videos and movies together with friends. With everyone living such busy lives, sometimes its hard to actually meet up in person to do something as simple as watch the latest TV show together. This app aims to facilitate video calls and watch parties so that friends and family can have the feeling of watching shows, videos, and movies together even when separated by the airwaves. This app was inspired by my own wants; I have often wanted to watch YouTube videos, or videos on other websites, with my friends, and have resorted to using apps like Zoom to share my screen with my friends and watch videos together.

        <!-- Design Statement -->
        <h2> Design Statement </h2>
        The "issue" is that it is often difficult to meet up in person if you want to casually watch things with your friends and families, with people living far from each other or having packed schedules. It is important to resolve this issue because these kinds of gatherings are forms of quality time at minimum, or powerful bonding experiences at best.

        <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                Existing solutions to this task usually are poorly designed or designed for other tasks, and simply happen to fill this niche. Specifically, the most common way of completing this task is to use a video calling tool, such as Zoom or Discord, and share your screen with the others in the call.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some products designed specifically to host watch parties with others. I analyzed two other products: <a href="https://www.kastapp.co">kastapp</a> and <a href="https://www.watchparty.me">watchparty</a>. I studied the heuristics of both apps and conducted a usability test of watchparty. Overall, I discovered that these competitors, while fulfilling their role, suffer from a few major usability flaws that make them annoying or difficult to use.
